       What is cyberbullying? The use of electronic communication to bully a person, typically by sending messages of an intimidating or threatening nature. So when you are using the internet and you feel like you are being cyberbullied tell an adult and they can end the situation. 
Don’t ever let a person on the internet make you feel bad about who you are because you were uniquely made to be who you are. So if a person makes you feel otherwise it's because they’re not satisfied with who they were made to be.

        My platform will be for people who have seen/experienced Cyber bullying.
With the prevalence of social media and digital forums, comments, photos, posts, and content shared by individuals can often be viewed by strangers as well as acquaintances. The content an individual shares online – both their personal content as well as any negative, mean, or hurtful content – creates a kind of permanent public record of their views, activities, and behavior. This public record can be thought of as an online reputation, which may be accessible to schools, employers, colleges, clubs, and others who may be researching an individual now or in the future. Cyberbullying can harm the online reputations of everyone involved – not just the person being bullied, but those doing the bullying or participating in it. Cyberbullying has unique concerns in that it can be:
<br>
Persistent – Digital devices offer an ability to immediately and continuously communicate 24 hours a day, so it can be difficult for children experiencing cyberbullying to find relief.
<br>
Permanent – Most information communicated electronically is permanent and public, if not reported and removed. A negative online reputation, including for those who bully, can impact college admissions, employment, and other areas of life.
