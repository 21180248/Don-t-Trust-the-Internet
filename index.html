       What is cyberbullying? The use of electronic communication to bully a person, typically by sending messages of an intimidating or threatening nature. So when you are using the internet and you feel like you are being cyberbullied tell an adult and they can end the situation. 
Don’t ever let a person on the internet make you feel bad about who you are because you were uniquely made to be who you are. So if a person makes you feel otherwise it's because they’re not satisfied with who they were made to be.
